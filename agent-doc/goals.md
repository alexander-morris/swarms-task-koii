# Goals for Fixing Test Issues

## Overview
This document outlines the goals for fixing the test issues in the Integrated Swarm Task System, specifically focusing on the coordinator component.

## Key Goals

### 1. Fix Sign Utils Test Failures
- **File:** `src/utils/sign.test.ts`
- **Issue:** `Keypair` is undefined, causing tests to fail.
- **Goal:** Ensure `Keypair` is correctly imported or mocked to resolve the `TypeError`.

### 2. Resolve Swarm Test Suite Failure
- **File:** `src/tests/swarm.test.ts`
- **Issue:** Type mismatch in `SwarmStatus`.
- **Goal:** Update the `SwarmStatus` type or the assignment in `updateSwarmStatus.ts` to ensure compatibility.

### 3. Remove Mongoose Duplicate Index Warning
- **Issue:** Duplicate schema index on `{"job_id":1}`.
- **Goal:** Review Mongoose schema definitions and remove duplicate index declarations.

### 4. Ensure Proper Test Teardown
- **Issue:** Tests are leaking resources, causing worker processes to fail to exit gracefully.
- **Goal:** Review test teardown logic to ensure all resources (e.g., database connections, timers) are closed properly.

### 5. Update Jest Config for ts-jest
- **Issue:** Deprecated `ts-jest` configuration.
- **Goal:** Update the Jest configuration to follow the latest best practices for `ts-jest`.

## Next Steps
- Address each goal one at a time, starting with the Sign Utils Test Failures.
- Document progress and any additional issues encountered during the process.
